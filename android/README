App 1 - URoBu - User pRofile Builder

This app colects data about the devices in the smart space allowing to map
	which capabilities are not yet addressed and which user is the best to
	reach when they are available.

This app work as follows:
	- The Application runs on a more capable device (like a PC)
	- Whenever a new device is found, an Agent is sent to collect data like:
		- Who is the user
		- The platform in which the dvice is running (SO, JVM)
		- The CPU capabilities
		- The Screen Resolution
		- Which type of camera it has
		- Which type of auido input (mic) and output it has (speaker)
		- Which type of keyboard it has
		- Is it touch eneabled? Mutitouch?
		- Which resources are available through the uOS
	- This data populates the User Ontology.
	- This data helps to map which resources we have in the smart space and
		who is responsible for it. This gives us a profile about the user and
		which capabilities he could be providing to the smart space.
